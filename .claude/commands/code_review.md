## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**FACTUAL ACCURACY ONLY**: 
- Base ALL findings and statements ONLY on actual code analysis and the provided notes file
- DO NOT make assumptions, inferences, or add information not explicitly found in the source code or notes
- If information is not available in the code or notes, explicitly state "Information not available" or omit the section
- DO NOT speculate about functionality, performance, or implementation details
- When in doubt, err on the side of omission rather than inclusion

**SOURCE-BASED ANALYSIS**:
- Every statement must be traceable to specific code files, lines, or the notes document
- Quote directly from source code when describing functionality
- Reference specific file paths and line numbers when discussing implementation details
- Use exact language from the notes file when describing test coverage status

## Your Task

Perform a comprehensive Rails code review following **Sandi Metz principles** and Rails best practices. Focus on object-oriented design, maintainability, and Rails conventions.

### Core Review Areas

#### 1. **Sandi Metz Rules Compliance**
- **Classes**: No longer than 100 lines
- **Methods**: No longer than 5 lines
- **Parameters**: No more than 4 parameters
- **Instance variables**: No more than 4 per controller action
- **Lines**: No more than 80 characters per line

#### 2. **Object-Oriented Design**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/method has one reason to change
- **Tell, Don't Ask**: Objects handle their own data and behavior
- **Law of Demeter**: Avoid chaining method calls
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Prefer composition and modules
- **Dependency Injection**: Avoid hard-coded dependencies

#### 3. **Rails-Specific Patterns**
- **Fat Models, Skinny Controllers**: Business logic in models, not controllers
- **RESTful Design**: Proper use of Rails REST conventions
- **ActiveRecord Best Practices**: Efficient queries, proper associations
- **Strong Parameters**: Proper parameter filtering and security
- **Service Objects**: Complex business logic extracted to services

#### 4. **Rails 8 + PostgreSQL + RSpec Quality**
- **ActiveRecord Efficiency**: N+1 queries, proper includes/joins
- **PostgreSQL Features**: Appropriate use of JSONB, arrays, indexes
- **Solid Queue Jobs**: Proper background job patterns
- **Solid Cache**: Efficient caching strategies
- **RSpec Testing**: Well-structured, readable tests
- **FactoryBot Usage**: Clean, maintainable test factories

#### 5. **Security & Performance**
- **Rails Security**: CSRF, mass assignment, SQL injection prevention
- **Authentication**: Secure bcrypt implementation
- **Authorization**: Proper access control patterns
- **Performance**: Database queries, caching, memory usage
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and proper logging

#### 6. **Code Style & Maintainability**
- **Naming**: Clear, intention-revealing names
- **Comments**: Code explains why, not what
- **Duplication**: DRY principle application
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity kept low
- **Refactoring**: Code smells identification
